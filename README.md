Organize Symbols Plugin For Sketch
==================================

## Quickly arrange your symbol artboards

Is your Symbols page getting out of control?

Quickly line them up with this plugin!

Symbol page must be named "Symbols"


## Install

Copy **`OrganizeSymbols.sketchplugin`** to **Sketch** plugins folder.


## Shortcut

*`cmd` + `ctrl` + `shift` +* **`o`**

## Motivation:
Organising symbols into a nice neat line is great if you only 5 of them, but it definately does not work to scale. This plugin attempts to organise a large number of symbols, like those used in an enterprise design system. Symbol groups are extracted, sorted and laid out to make it easier to organise, search & find symobls within a libray of 1000's.

## Layout:
Symbol groups are organised aphabetically on the y axis, and the artboards within the group are organised alphabetically on the x axis.
