Organize Symbols Plugin For Sketch
==================================

## Quickly arrange your symbol artboards

Is your Symbols page getting out of control?

![Organize Symbols](screens/OrganizeSymbols.gif?raw=true "Organize Symbols")

Quickly line them up with this plugin!

Symbol page must be named "Symbols"


## Install

Copy **`OrganizeSymbols.sketchplugin`** to **Sketch** plugins folder.


## Shortcut

*`cmd` + `ctrl` + `shift` +* **`o`**


## To Do (Coming Soon)

At the moment, all it can do is line up your symbols in one row, but eventually I'd like it to have:

- Ability to set amount per line

- Ability to set space between rows and columns

- Ability organize by section
